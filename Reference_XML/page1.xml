'''Lynn''' is a city in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. The population was 89,050 at the 2000 census.  An old industrial center, Lynn is home to Lynn Beach and Lynn Heritage State Park and is about 12 miles north of downtown Boston.

==History==
===17th century===
The area known as Lynn was first settled in 1629 by [[Edmund Ingalls]] (d. 1647) and incorporated in 1631 as [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]], the [[Nipmuck]] name for the area.&lt;ref name=herbert&gt;Herbert, George. [http://www.usigs.org/library/books/ma/Lynn1890/index.html History of Lynn... 1629&amp;ndash;1864], 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; The name Lynn was given to the area after [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]], in honor of [[Samuel Whiting]].&lt;ref name=cihist&gt;[http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/Public_Documents/0008DBA7-70E903AC About the City of Lynn, MA] at City of Lynn website&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lynn's re-settlement many parts of the town were set off as independent towns. [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]] was created in 1644, [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]] in 1782, [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]] in 1815, [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]] in 1852, and [[Nahant, Massachusetts|Nahant]] in 1853. Lynn was incorporated as a city in 1850.

Colonial Lynn was a major part of the regional [[tanning|tannery]] and shoe-making industries that began in 1635. The boots worn by [[Continental Army]] soldiers during the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] were made in Lynn. The shoe-making industry drove urban growth in Lynn into the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=cihist/&gt; This historic theme is reflected in the city seal, which features a colonial boot.&lt;ref name=citysite&gt;[http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/ City of Lynn] official website&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
In 1816, a mail stage coach was operating through Lynn. By 1836, 23 stage coaches left the Lynn Hotel for Boston each day. The [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] Line between Salem and East Boston opened on August 28, 1838. This was later merged with the [[Boston and Maine]] Railroad and called the Eastern Division. In 1847 telegraph wires passed through Lynn, but no telegraph service station was built till 1858.&lt;ref name=AnnalsOfLynn1858&gt;[http://www.usigs.org/library/books/ma/Lynn1890/lynn02Ch2-1814.txt USigs.org], History of Lynn Ch2-1814&amp;ndash;1864 pub1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn Shoe manufacturers, lead by [[Charles A. Coffin]] and Silas Abbott Barton, invested in the early electric industry, specifically in 1883 with [[Elihu Thomson]] and his [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]]. That company merged with [[Edison Electric Company]] of [[Schenectady, New York]], forming [[General Electric]] in 1892, with the two original GE plants being in Lynn and Schenectady. [[Charles A. Coffin]] served as the first president of [[General Electric]].
[[Elihu Thomson]] later served as acting president of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1920 to 1923.&lt;ref name=ElihuThomsonPapers&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/library/mole/t/thomson.htm Amphilsoc.org], Elihu Thomson Papers at the American Philosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially the General Electric plant specialized in arc lights, electric motors, and meters. Later they specialized in aircraft electrical systems and components, and aircraft engines were built in Lynn during WWII. That engine plant evolved into the current jet engine plant during WWII because of research contacts at MIT in Cambridge.&lt;ref name=MassMomentsLynnJetEngine&gt;[http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=117 Massmoments.org], MassMoments GE Jet Engine Tests in Lynn&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerhard Neumann]] was a key player in jet engine group at GE in Lynn. The continuous interaction of material science research at MIT and the resulting improvements in jet engine efficiency and power have kept the jet engine plant in Lynn ever since.

===20th century===
Lynn's population peaked around 1930 at just over 102,000 and the population today is roughly where it was in 1910.  Yet de-industrialization has meant that median household income for Lynn is well below the statewide average.

Lynn suffered several large [[fires]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including a devastating inferno among former shoe factories at Broad and Washington Streets on November 28, 1981.  The blaze destroyed 17 downtown buildings undergoing redevelopment, with property losses totaling in the tens of millions of dollars.  The site has since been largely redeveloped into a satellite campus of [[North Shore Community College]].

Due to a reputation for high crime that has persisted since the beginning of industrialization, a taunting rhyme about Lynn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Historic Shops &amp; Restaurants of Boston|last=Méras|first=Phyllis|year=2007|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kerry.senate.gov/cfm/record.cfm?id=288018|title=Don't Leave New England Families Out in the Cold|last=Kerry|first=John|site=United States Senate|date=2007-11-27|accessdate=2010-01-13}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been known throughout Eastern Massachusetts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Lynn, Lynn, city of sin
You never come out the way you went in
Ask for water, they give you a gin
the girls say no, but always give in
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In order to end the popular chant, city solicitor Michael Barry proposed renaming the city to Ocean Park in 1997, but this failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Boston Globe]]|title=Rhyme may be reason to change Lynn's name|last=Daley|first=Beth|date=1997-03-06|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-8408766.html|accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn remains home to a division of [[General Electric Aviation]], a major employer; the West Lynn Creamery (now part of [[Dean Foods]]'s Garelick Farms unit); C. L. Hauthaway &amp; Sons, a polymer producer; Old Neighborhood Foods, a meat packer; Lynn Manufacturing, a maker of combustion chambers for the oil and gas heating industry; Sterling Machine Co.; and Durkee-Mower, makers of &quot;[[Marshmallow creme|Marshmallow Fluff]]&quot;.

In order to counter the reputation as &quot;the city of sin&quot;, Lynn created an advertising campaign in the early 1990s to improve the city's image. The &quot;City Of Firsts&quot; campaign boasted that Lynn had the:

* First [[iron works]] (1643)
* First [[Fire apparatus|fire engine]] (1654)
* First American [[jet engine]]
* First woman in [[advertising]] &amp; [[mass-marketing]] &amp;mdash; [[Lydia Pinkham]]
* First [[baseball|baseball game]] under artificial light
* First [[dance]] academy in the U.S.
* First [[Tanning|tannery]] in the U.S.
* First [[air mail]] transport in New England, from Saugus, MA to Lynn, MA.
* First [[roast beef]] sandwich.
* First [[Tulip]] in the United States, at the Fay Estate near [[Spring Pond]]

Later, some of these claims were found to be inaccurate or unprovable. (For example, the first baseball game under artificial light appears to have actually occurred in [[Indiana]].)

The first wave of immigration began in the early 1990s when many Jewish people emigrated from Russia to Lynn, which has become home to one of the largest Russian communities in the North Shore.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===21st century===
In the early 2000s, a number of new development projects have contributed to what officials hope will be the city's renaissance. Industrial buildings that were formerly vacant have been converted into [[loft]] spaces by real estate developers, and bought by young home-buyers who seek the urban lifestyle of Boston proper, but can't afford the higher prices of Boston's South End and similar neighborhoods{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. Encouraged by local developer Tom Kennedy, [[New Urbanist]] architect [[Robert Orr]] proposed a series of [[charettes]] for the redevelopment of Lynn's waterfront in conjunction with Lynnfield Engineering. City Hall is encouraging the community's resurgence, with new antique-style lighting, signage, brickwork, and a multipurpose municipal [[American football|football]] [[stadium]].

In late 2009, Judith Flanagan Kennedy became mayor by a margin of only 27 votes (out of a vote total of over 16,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.lynn.ma.us/citydepartments_clerk_votingresults_november_2009.shtml |work=Lynn City Clerk and Elections|title= ELECTION SUMMARY REPORT: Municipal Election - November 3, 2009, Lynn, MA. |publisher=City of Lynn |accessdate=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, beating out two-term incumbent mayor Edward J. Clancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bostonherald.com/news/politics/view/20100108lynn_mayor_city_hall_e-mails_files_cleaned_out_by_predecessor_bare-thee-well/srvc=home&amp;position=5|first= Edward| last= Mason |title=Lynn mayor: City Hall e-mails, files cleaned out by predecessor |publisher= Boston Herald |date= January 8, 2010|accessdate=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and transportation==
[[Image:Goldfish Pond, Lynn, MA.jpg|thumb|right|''Goldfish Pond'' in 1905]]
Lynn is located at {{Coord|42|28|26|N|70|57|20|W|city}} (42.473996, &amp;minus;70.955583).{{GR|1}} According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 13.5&amp;nbsp;square miles (34.9&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 10.8&amp;nbsp;square miles (28.0&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 2.7&amp;nbsp;square miles (6.9&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (19.87%) is water.  Lynn is located beside [[Massachusetts Bay]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  Lynn's shoreline is divided in half by the town of [[Nahant, Massachusetts|Nahant]], which divides Lynn Harbor to the south from Nahant Bay to the north.  The town lies north of the [[Saugus River]], and is also home to several brooks, as well as several ponds, the largest being Breed's Pond and Walden Pond (which has no relation to a [[Walden Pond|similarly named pond]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]].  More than a quarter of the town's land is covered by the [[Lynn Woods Reservation]], which takes up much of the land in the northwestern part of town.  The town is also home to two beaches, Lynn Beach and King's Beach, both of which lie along Nahant Bay, as well as a boat ramp in Lynn Harbor.

Lynn is located in the southern part of Essex County, and is five miles southwest of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], ten miles northeast of [[Boston]], and twenty-two miles west-southwest of [[Cape Ann]].  The city is bordered by Nahant to the south, [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]] to the east, Salem to the northeast, [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]] to the north, [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]] to the northwest, [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]] to the west, and [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]] (in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]) to the southeast.  Lynn's water rights extend into Nahant Bay, and share Lynn Harbor with Nahant.  There is no land connection to Revere; the only connection is the General Edwards Bridge across the Saugus River.  Besides its downtown district, Lynn is also divided into East Lynn and West Lynn, which are further divided into even smaller areas.

Lynn is loosely segmented into the following neighborhoods:

Central:
* Downtown / Business District
* Central Square

West Lynn:
* Pine Hill
* McDonough Sq./ Barry Park
* Tower Hill / Austin Sq. - Saugus River
* The Brickyard
* The Commons
* Walnut St./Lynnhurst
* Veteran's Village

East Lynn:
* Diamond  District / Lynn Shore
* Wyoma Sq.
* The Highlands
* The Fay Estates
* Ward 1 / Lynnfield St.
* Goldfish Pond
* The Meadow / Keaney Park

===Transportation===
Lynn has no full highways, the nearest being [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] in Saugus and the combined [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] and [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] in Lynnfield.  [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]], [[Massachusetts Route 107|Route 107]], [[Massachusetts Route 129|Route 129]] and [[Massachusetts Route 129A|Route 129A]] all pass through the town.  Route 107 passes from southwest to northeast along a relatively straight right-of-way through town.  It shares a half mile concurrency with Route 129A, which follows Route 129's old route through town between its parent route and Route 1A.  Route 129 passes from the north of town before turning south and passing through the downtown area and becoming concurrent with Route 1A for a mile.  Route 1A passes from Revere along the western portion of the Lynnway, a divided highway within town, before passing further inland into Swampscott.  The Lynnway itself stays along the shoreline, leading to a rotary which links the road to Nahant Road and Lynn Shore Drive, which follows the coast into Swampscott.

Lynn has a [[Lynn (MBTA station)|stop]] on the [[Newburyport/Rockport Line]] of the [[MBTA Commuter Rail]], and several [[MBTA bus routes in Saugus, Lynn, and Salem|MBTA bus routes]] that connect it with Boston and the neighboring communities.. There are ongoing studies on the feasibility of extending the [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] subway to the city.  The nearest airport is Boston's [[Logan International Airport]].
In December 2007, the Massachusetts Seaport Advisory Council approved $750,000 in funding for a commuter ferry from Lynn to Boston. The Massachusetts Seaport Advisory Council provided a $1.3 million grant for Phase 2 of the project in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
